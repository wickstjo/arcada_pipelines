setup:

    # WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAME AND RUN_NAME?
    # Answer: name specifies the experiment's overall name, 
    # while run_name identifies the parent run under which multiple child runs are organized. 
    # In this setup, run_name acts as the main run grouping the child runs, 
    # where one child run is for SVR and the other for SVC
    
    name: SVR_SVC_chain_experiment
    run_name: f"SVR_SVC_runs_{num_rows}"

    # I WOULD REMOVE THIS AS ITS PART OF THE CLUSTER ENV
    # AND NOT RELEVANT FOR THE MODEL RECIPE ITSELF
    # Answer: I agree with you. This should be removed from the experiment.yaml file.

    tracking_uri: "http://193.167.37.47:5000"

    # WHY LIST THESE HERE?
    # Answer: I'm not sure why these need to be listed here. From my understanding, these represent the model execution sequence, 
    # which will be executed in the specified order in the list.

    models:
        - svr-model
        - svc-model

    # THE DEPENDENCY IS IMPLIED SINCE THE LIST OF MODELS UNDER THE MODELS PROPERTY
    # IS A SEQUENCE OF MODELS
    # Answer: I agree with you. The model execution sequence is already defined in the models property, 
    # and this property will determine whether it is applied or not.

    # MAYBE COMBINE THESE

    # WHY USE AN ARRAY?
    # WOULD YOU REALISTICALLY EVER USE MULTIPLE SYMBOLS WITH ONE QUERY?
    # Answer: I agree with you. It is unlikely that multiple symbols will be used in one query.
    symbols: [AAPL]

    # # EXAMPLE REFACTOR
    # stock_symbol: AAPL

    # I ASSUME THIS IS A VARIABLE VALUE THAT CHANGES
    # FOR EACH EXPERIMENT?
    # Answer: Yes, this is a variable value that changes for each parent run, one experiment multiple run.

    # DO WE EVER NEED DATA IN DESCENDING ORDER?
    # Answer: I don't think we need data in descending order. I kept it if we need in future.
